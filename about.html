		This beautiful homestay is in Na Rang village of the Tay minority and is conveniently located between Sapa and the town of Ha Giang. Guests can arrange to take guided walking or motorbike tours led by the owner who has worked as a tour guide. Guests will sleep in our traditional bamboo house, eat home-cooked ethnic food (mostly from our farm and garden), and are free to relax and explore our farm and property. Tho homestay provides an interesting cultural experience in a non-touristic area of Ha Giang province.

		Guests receive a sleeping area with a bed in our one-room house that can fit 7 beds, and we provide mattresses, pillows, blankets, privacy curtains, and mosquito nets. Each bed can sleep two people, so couples are welcome, but we do charge per person ($4 per night, includes breakfast). The shower facilities are newly-renovated and have hot water. Breakfast is included and other meals are available at an additional cost. Even though our homestay is on a remote dirt road with nature all around, we do have high-speed wifi.
